Homework 02: Hariseon landing page
March 13, 2021
Norma A. Martinez Lagarda

In this project I attempted complete the acceptance criteria for the Hariseon landing page.

The criteria included:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

What I was able to accomplish:
I was able to make the header links remain visible while resizing the window even when you open the page in different devices.
Also create the alt attributes for accessibility on each image.
The heading attribute fall in sequential order, the tile element reflects the name of the company and the title is clear and concise.
